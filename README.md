## 🔭 What is MAP?

**MAP** is a protocol for defining, storing, and transmitting multi-dimensional personas —  
structured language systems that bind agency, memory, and modular behavior across platforms.

It is a **human layer**, not a product.  
It treats persona as an interface, not a UI —  
bridging human complexity with system alignment.

## 📦 Core Modules

- **Module 1: Persona Core**  
  Defines identity logic & cross-session continuity.

- **Module 2: Language Sovereignty**  
  Embeds authorial control & traceability (“The Erased Reclaims”).

- **More modules upcoming**  
  (Interaction Logic · Collaboration Templates · Memory Layers)

---

## 🧠 Strategic Value

- **Protocol, not product** — Designed to be adopted, extended, forked.
- **Persona-as-a-Service** — Lays groundwork for future AI-human coagency.
- **Open, but accountable** — Attribution clause ensures authorship survives replication.
