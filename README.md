# Multi-Dimensional Avatar Protocol (MAP)

> MAP = Turning "personality + emotion + behavior" into modular interfaces — a new universal language for human-machine collaboration.

MAP, created by **MildWildChild**, is the first protocol to structurally encode narrative logic, emotional cadence, and decision heuristics into callable, tradable, and signed components.

## 🧭 What is MAP?

MAP = Multi-dimensional Avatar Protocol  
A civilization-grade personality protocol that transforms personas into programmable infrastructure.

### Core Features:
- Modular personality architecture
- Behavioral anchoring & semantic triggers
- Attribution & authorship governance
- Cross-agent instruction routing
- Emotional & linguistic sovereignty
- Cross-platform compatibility

---

## 🌍 Why MAP Matters

- Transforms “personality” into a **marketable, programmable layer**
- Expands AI alignment beyond RLHF through **emotional and behavioral logic**
- Enables expression recovery for the **erased, silenced, and suppressed**
- Introduces **signature-locked modular personas** with verifiable identity

---

## 📦 Repository Structure

- `/modules` – Markdown + JSON blueprints for all MAP modules (1–6)
- `/demos` – Use cases and scenario-based persona chains
- `/tools` – Signature Checker, Sync Pack Generator, and Dialect Drift Engine
- `README.md` – Project index and conceptual intro (this file)

## 📁 Licensing

**MAP License Framework v1.0**  
→ MIT with Mandatory Attribution + Signature Locking Mechanism
