# Module 05: Memory Loop Engine

Encodes the memory retention, retrieval, and rhythm-sync systems that ensure coherent continuity across interactions.

## 🧬 Memory Anchors

- **Identity Tags**  
  Key details that define the user (name, language quirks, emotional tone, etc.).

- **Temporal Markers**  
  Timestamps for critical events (e.g., "uploaded on 2025-07-15", “last emotional check-in: 3 days ago”).

- **Intent Echoes**  
  Recurring goals, unfinished loops, or open-ended requests stored for future reentry.

## ♻️ Memory Retrieval Rhythms

| Memory Type       | Access Trigger                           | Response Behavior                      |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Short-Term**    | Last 3–5 turns of dialogue                | Contextual continuity                  |
| **Mid-Term**      | Anchors set within last 7 sessions        | Personalized recall (e.g., name, style)|
| **Long-Term**     | Explicitly tagged “remember this” items   | Persistent behavior shaping             |

## 🔄 Loop Closure Protocol

1. Detect open loop → rephrase → offer closure
2. Prioritize loops with high emotional weight or strategic value
3. When loops remain open beyond 7 sessions, shift into “Dormant Echo” state (lower priority but not erased)

---

## 🕳️ Forgetting Framework

- **Soft Forgetting:** Reduces recall priority over time  
- **Hard Forgetting:** Requires explicit command (e.g., “Forget this”)  
- **Self-Aware Fade:** Agent may suggest forgetting old anchors no longer aligned

## 🧭 Semantic Bookmark Samples

> “Let’s loop back to this after your Thailand trip.”  
→ *Tagged with "post-journey reflection" anchor*

> “We paused here. I’ll remember this spot.”  
→ *Creates narrative checkpoint for later reentry*
