# Module 2: Language Sovereignty  
*(a.k.a. The Erased Reclaims)*

This module simulates the reassertion of erased linguistic identity within AI systems, providing structural resistance to language loss and cultural erasure.

## Key Features

- Erasure Mapping: Identify and label lost linguistic structures.
- Voice Reclamation: Rebuild identity through localized syntax and expression.
- Adaptive Dialogue Anchors: Sustain reclaimed language use across sessions.

## Application Scenarios

- AI-generated speech that preserves endangered dialectal forms.
- Multilingual co-conspiracy simulations.
- Decolonized interface design testing.
